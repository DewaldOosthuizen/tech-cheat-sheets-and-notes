A growing collection of technology cheat sheets — quick-reference study notes organised by topic
and certification track. Comparisons between services, decision flows, and Mermaid diagrams that
answer "which one and why?" — not step-by-step tutorials or portal walkthroughs.

## Current Content

| Topic |
| ---- |
| [Microsoft Azure](docs/azure/index.md) |
| [Amazon Web Services](docs/aws/index.md) |
| [Google Cloud](docs/google/index.md) |
| [Programming (Java)](docs/programming/java/index.md) |

More topics (other cloud providers, DevOps tooling, architecture patterns) will be added over time.
Each new topic lives under its own subdirectory inside `docs/`.

## Repository Structure

```

    files/
      <domain>/<domain>.md       — One page per domain (networking, security, …)
    diagrams/<section>/         — standalone Mermaid diagram sources (one per file)

mkdocs.yml                      — MkDocs Material site configuration
```

## Local Setup

Requirements: Python 3.11+, Node/npm on PATH.

```bash
# One-time per clone: creates .venv, installs Python + Node deps
make install

# Install pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
.venv/bin/pip install pre-commit
.venv/bin/pre-commit install
```

## Viewing the Documentation Site

Serve it locally with hot-reload:

```bash
make start   # opens http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Build a static copy:

```bash
make docs-build   # output in site/
```

GitHub also renders Mermaid natively in Markdown files. VS Code users can
install `Markdown Preview Mermaid Support` to render diagrams in the editor
preview.

## Running CI Locally

```bash
make ci
```

Runs in order: markdownlint, Mermaid validation, ruff lint + format check,
pytest with coverage, and a strict MkDocs build. A failing `make ci` means
the GitHub Actions pipeline will also fail — fix it before opening a PR.

For dead-link checking, run:

```bash
make link-check
```

`make link-check` bootstraps a pinned Lychee binary into `.tools/` on first
use, so no global Lychee installation is required.
