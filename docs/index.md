Quick-reference study notes for technology certifications and architecture decisions.
Each sheet answers *which service, which pattern, and why* — not how to click through a portal.
Content is comparison-oriented: tables, decision flowcharts, and Mermaid diagrams side-by-side.

## How to Use These Sheets

The cheat sheets are not meant to be read cover-to-cover. Jump to the section relevant to what
you are studying. Each section contains:

- A comparison table of services in that domain
- Exam-tip callouts that highlight common decision points in exam questions
- One or more Mermaid decision flowcharts for branching "which service?" scenarios
- Deprecation notices where a service has been retired or superseded

The live site renders all diagrams inline. To browse locally, run `make docs-serve`.
